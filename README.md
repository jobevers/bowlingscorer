# Bowling Score Stats

This script parses the database from the
[Bowling Scorer android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.gr.java_conf.yotchan.bowlingscorerfree).

In settings, you can save a backup of the database, which is stored in
`/BowlingScorer/Backup.db`. I transfer this database to my computer and
run the `parse_db.py` script to print out additional stats.

Output:
```
